# OpenReadingFrame-Counter
An open reading frame is defined as an area within a genome that is downstrean of the 'start' signal of ATG, 
and upstream of a stop signal of TAA, TAG or TGA. These areas are able to code for the mRNA, or messenger RNA, 
that gets translated into a protien. The larger the number of ORFs a sequence contains, the larger the number 
of different protiens it could possibly code for. Each triplet of bases codes for a protien, therefore the 
given sequence is analyzed 6 times: once for each forward reading frame and once for each reading frame on the
other strand of the DNA, which is the reverse compliment of the first sequence.
